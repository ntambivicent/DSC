                                    individuals and institutions in developing countries is crucial for the success of development
                                    policy. We appreciate also that one of the challenges working in a developing economy is
                                    shortage of skilled workforce, which can be developed through training. There is lack of
                                    ownership by recipients, incapacity to effect sustainable change, lack of inter-sectorial
                                    coordination, and insufficiently tailored-made approaches. DCS is determined to expand her
                                    well-established foundation in the area and excel in research and consultancy services in
                                    training and capacity development. You can rely on our training services because we are
                                    equipped with over ten years of experience in providing various forms of training and
                                    worked with highly educated and widely experienced experts and partners. Unlike capacitybuilding which suggests building something new from the ground up, with 'capacity
                                    development,’ we believe to build on existing skills and knowledge, driving a dynamic and
                                    flexible process of change, borne by local actors.

                                        capital investments through the business’ equity, debt or a mix of both. We understand that
                                        long-term funding for major capital expenditures or investments may be obtained from
                                        selling company stocks or issuing debt securities in the market through investment banks.
                                        We therefore help companies balance and effectively manage the two sources of funding
                                        (equity and debt) by optimizing the company’s capital structure by lowering its Weighted
                                        Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as much as possible.</p>

                                        returns. This’ mainly done by deciding whether or not to pursue an investment opportunity,
                                        and is accomplished through extensive financial analysis. DCS undertakes financial modeling
                                        to estimate the economic impact of an investment opportunity and compare alternative
                                        projects, employing the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) in conjunction with Net Present Value

                                        distribute the earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks. We strive
                                        to ensure and encourage companies to reinvest retained earnings, since these funds provide
                                        best source of funds, as it does not incur additional debts nor dilute the value of equity by
                                        issuing more shares. In doing this, we believe that companies can earn a rate of return on a
                                        capital investment that’s greater than the company’s cost of capital.</p>

                                    DCS, we help the project teams to effectively execute the formulation, evaluation and
                                    project management processes. We ensure that the processes (tasks and activities) have
                                    clear dependencies and are done following the same sequence in each project. They are
                                    independent from the area of application approaches. These groups of processes consider
                                    the multidimensional nature of formulation, evaluation and project management. This is one
                                    of the indicators of the maturity of a research and consultancy firm. Our clients trust us, so
                                    much so that they lean on us from the inception to the evaluation phase of the projects they
                                    undertake.
